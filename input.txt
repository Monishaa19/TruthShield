Instant payments app PhonePe faced intense backlash and boycott calls on social media after CEO and Co-Founder Sameer Nigam opposed the Karnataka government's proposed job quota bill, which seeks to reserve a portion of private sector jobs for locals.

The hashtags #UninstallPhonePe and #BoycottPhonePe trended on the micro-blogging site X throughout the day.

Sameer Nigam, who stated that he has created over 25,000 jobs across the country, argued that the bill is unfair to people like him who have lived in multiple states due to their parents' work.
