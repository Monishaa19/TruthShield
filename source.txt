Instant payments app PhonePe came under severe criticism and saw boycott calls on social media a day after company CEO and Co-Founder Sameer Nigam opposed the Karnataka government's proposed jobs quota bill, which aims to secure a portion of jobs in private sector for locals.

#UninstallPhonePe and #BoycottPhonePe kept trending on micro-blogging site X throughout the day.

Sameer Nigam, who said he has created over 25,000 jobs across the country, opposed the bill and said that it was unfair to people like him who have lived in multiple states due to their parents' work.
